## Helpful links for working on this project
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)
    - W3 Schools are fairly helpful at covering HTML/CSS/JS (and more) in a broad sense
- [JS @ W3](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
    - javascript tutorials (client side js)
    - [Also their AJAX tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ajax_intro.asp) is in javascript, and may be very helpful to understand how that works.
- [JQuery @ W3](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp)
    - Should note that jQuery is itself _written in javascript_. Everything you can do in jQuery you can do in vanilla JS, but it helps abstract the complexity away so you don't need to build boilerplate code yourself. I should note that it's really helpful if you can understand how to do something in vanilla JS before you learn how to do it in jQuery.
- [CSS @ W3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
    - css tutorials
- [JSON @ W3](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)
    - json tutorials
- [Node.js @ W3](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/default.asp)
    - node.js tutorials (server side js)
- [SQL @ W3](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)
    - structured query language (SQL) tutorials (applies to making queries to a MySQL DB)

- Additionally a few other sites I've found that may be helpful
    - Javascript
        - [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)
        - [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), Javascript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)
    - HTML

- For setting up the server in Node.js
    - [Node Package Manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/)
        - This will be used to help manage dependencies (like [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for the underlying server code) that we will need to setup a server in Node.js. Remember, node.js is not a server, it's just a different environment for interpreting and executing javascript than what you would have in your browser (also with some different rules in syntax). The concept of the server is just something that can be set up _in_ javascript.
            - [Wiki on what node.js is, and some history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)
            - [Stackoverflow post about what Node.JS is, in summary](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1884724/what-is-node-js)
    - [Blog about setting up your first Node.js server](https://blog.risingstack.com/your-first-node-js-http-server/)
        - <strong>This shows you how to actually set up a server with express</strong>

Instructions for setting this up (db & server) will be provided here so everyone can have this running on their own machines as needed.
